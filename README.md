# BT-CA

BT-CA creates a small CA, originally designed to provide SSL Certificates for OpenVPN installations, but it basically can be used for anything that uses SSL Certificates.
I also included a script for changing the PEM encoded files to PFX, which is used to import the certificates on windows.
